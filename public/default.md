## What You're Getting

So here's the deal — the website I'm going to build you runs on the same technology that Netflix and Nike use. This isn't WordPress, this isn't Wix. This is production-grade tech that Fortune 500 companies pay engineering teams six figures to maintain.

Normally a build like this runs anywhere from $5,000 to $10,000. I'm offering it to you for $3,000 — and that's because I want to build a long-term relationship, not just hand you a site and disappear.

Here's what's included at that price:

- **Custom-built website** on the same tech stack as Netflix & Nike (Next.js / React)
- **SEO baked in from day one** — structured so Google actually finds you and ranks you
- **GEO-optimized** — that means your business shows up in AI search results too (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews) — most agencies don't even know this exists yet
- **Mobile-first design** — looks and works great on every device
- **Fast, secure, and modern** — no bloated plugins, no page builders slowing you down
- **AI-powered features** coming soon — we're building intelligent tools that can answer your customers' questions right on your site (this is still in development, but you'll be first in line)

**How payment works:**

- $1,500 upfront to kick off the project
- $1,500 when the site is complete and you're happy with it
- Timeline: 4 to 8 weeks from start to launch

You're not just getting a website — you're getting the highest level of technology available, at a price that's fair for both of us.

## After We Launch

32. Do you want us to keep maintaining and updating the site after it goes live?
33. Are you interested in showing up in AI search results (like ChatGPT and Google AI) in addition to regular Google?

## Monthly Maintenance Options

Once your site is live, I offer two tiers to keep everything running and growing:

**Standard Maintenance — $150–$300/month**

- Content updates and minor changes
- Security patches and software updates
- Hosting and uptime monitoring
- Monthly SEO check-ins
- Priority support when you need something fixed or changed

**AI-Powered Maintenance — $400–$600/month**

- Everything in Standard, plus:
- **AI voice agent** that answers your customers' questions and handles calls 24/7 (powered by Retell AI)
- Call monitoring and AI prompt tuning
- Monthly analytics and call reports
- AI usage costs included

Think about it this way — the AI plan is cheaper than one part-time employee, and it never calls in sick, never takes a day off, and never puts a customer on hold.

34. Which maintenance tier interests you?
   - Standard ($150–$300/month)
   - AI-Powered ($400–$600/month)
   - Not sure yet — tell me more later
